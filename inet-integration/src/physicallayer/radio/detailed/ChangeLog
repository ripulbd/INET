	Ported the physical layer from MiXiM as a new radio model with the following notable changes:
	Adapted to implement the new radio contract.
	Renamed a number of classes to have a naming convention similar to the other radios.
	Renamed to DetailedRadio, DetailedRadioChannel, DetailedRadioChannelAccess, DetailedRadioFrame, etc.
	Adapted to use the radio mode and reception/transmission states from the contract.
	Added code that emits signals when the radio mode or reception/transmission states change.
	Changed logging to use the new omnetpp logging API and deleted all debug and coreDebug parameters.
	Deleted power consumption code because that is shared among different radios and it's implemented as a separate module.
	Deleted the global WorldUtility module to avoid forcing another global module on the user.
	Moved the radio signal creation from the MAC protocols to the radio modules.
	Deleted input/output control gates because in INET communication between layers use one connection, there's no real separate degree of freedom.
	Changed to send up collisions/bit errors as normal packets with special kinds as expected by MAC protocols.
	Changed ChannelState to be able to express idle, busy and receiving channel states.
